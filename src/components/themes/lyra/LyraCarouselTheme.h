// Functional port of CrossInk's Lyra Carousel home theme (https://github.com/uxjulia/CrossInk,
// also a CrossPoint fork -- see NOTICE): a large center cover flanked by smaller perspective
// -skewed side covers, a title, dot pagination, a progress bar with percentage, and a bottom
// icon-only button menu alongside the normal button-hints row. Differences from CrossInk's
// version:
//  - The disk-backed frame cache that pre-renders adjacent carousel frames for instant scrolling
//    (CrossInk's HomeActivity.cpp: gCarouselCache, sliding-window pre-render, setPreRenderIndex).
//    This theme redraws normally on selection change, like every other CrossFade theme does.
//  - No reading-stats "time read" label (this fork has no reading-stats subsystem to source it
//    from) -- CrossFade's own real per-book percentage is used for the progress bar instead of
//    approximating CrossInk's stats-driven one.
//  - Menu icons are CrossFade's own existing 32px icon set (FolderIcon/RecentIcon/Settings2Icon/
//    TransferIcon/PinIcon -- the same assets LyraTheme's list menu uses), not CrossInk's.
// The perspective skew (GfxRenderer::drawPerspectiveBitmap, ported from CrossInk's own
// GfxRenderer -- see its declaration), the two-tier center/side cover sizing below, and the
// bidirectional (both-axis) cover cropping in the .cpp are straight ports of CrossInk's own
// formulas, using CrossInk's own literal pixel constants (including homeCoverHeight -- see its
// comment above: it fits both X3 and X4's real portrait screen height with room to spare, so
// none of this needed re-solving for a smaller value).

  // height is homeCoverHeight minus a fixed 60px), kDisplayCenterW/H is 86% of that plus a 24px
  // clamp, floored at the ceiling itself. Because width and height derive independently (86%+24
  // of DIFFERENT base numbers), the resulting box is not aspect-locked to the cover art's own
  // portrait shape -- CrossInk's drawCenterCover crops whichever axis (width or height) has
  // surplus to fill the box exactly rather than requiring the box to match the image, which is
  // why the cover-drawing code here crops both axes (cropX AND cropY), not just cropX.
