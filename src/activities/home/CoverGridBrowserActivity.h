// Alternative to FileBrowserActivity AND RecentBooksActivity: a paginated grid
// of cover thumbnails, either the whole SD card (SETTINGS.fileBrowserView) or
// the recent-books list (SETTINGS.recentBooksView); both default to the stock
// list activity, this is strictly opt-in. Reached from HomeActivity::
// onFileBrowserOpen()/onRecentsOpen() -- see ActivityManager::
// goToCoverGridBrowser()/goToCoverGridRecentBooks(). Everything below is
// source-agnostic except loadBooks() (where the list comes from), the initial
// selection in onEnter() (last-read search vs. index 0 -- redundant for
// RecentBooks, which is already MRU-ordered), and the empty-state message.
//
// Series grouping (SETTINGS.groupBySeries) only ever applies to Source::Library -- RecentBooks
// keeps its own MRU semantics unchanged and never groups (see loadBooks()). When entries collapse
// into a series (see LibraryGrouping), selecting one drills into a second-level page listing that
// series' books in index order, rendered with the exact same grid code -- currentEntries() is the
// only thing that differs between the top-level page and a series page.
